# Interview Scheduler

This is a single-page app built in React that allows users to add, delete, and modify appointments for an interview. It uses [a local API] (https://github.com/jamesraymondbrown/scheduler-api) to populate the project with interviews, as well as store created interviews. 

It was built using React, PSQL, Storybook, Jest, and Cypress.
